Title: "Exploring the Future of Consciousness: Can We Preserve and Revive the Human Mind with Physics, Neuroscience, and Computers?"

Abstract: "Originally started as a playful conversation among friends, this research soon evolved into a fascinating theoretical problem that can be mathematically modeled and even simulated in a virtual environment. In this paper, we explore the futuristic concept of 'mind uploading', a process that could potentially allow human consciousness to be 'resurrected' or transferred from the human brain to a digital platform.
This could be achieved through advanced technologies like brain-computer interfaces, brain transplants, or prosthetics. We investigate the physical boundaries that might limit such a process. To model this, we use a method based on 'information geometry', a field of mathematics that allows us to represent and analyze complex information systems using geometric and topological techniques.
We draw parallels with the concept of holography, a technique in optics that allows a three-dimensional image to be stored and recreated from a two-dimensional hologram. This analogy helps us develop a mathematical model that represents the functionality of a 'toy mind' (a simplified model of the mind) as a geometric shape on an 'information manifold' (a mathematical space of all possible states of the mind). This shape can be represented as a distributed hologram, providing a dispersed representation of the system.
The process of creating this holographic representation offers a strategy for transferring the mind from its original biological environment to a digital one, and potentially back again. We model the interface between the brain and the digital environment as a flow of entropy (a measure of disorder or randomness), which we define as a geometric flow on the information manifold. This flow is analogous to the recording process in holography for the toy mind. The reverse process, akin to the reconstruction of a hologram, is modeled by non-local Hamiltonians (mathematical operators used in quantum mechanics) defined on the information manifold."

Introduction:
"The concept of 'resurrection' is often discussed in religious contexts, but it has received limited attention from the scientific community. In this paper, we explore this idea from the perspective of physics and biochemistry.
At first glance, it might seem impossible to reconstruct a natural physical or biological system by assembling its original elements. This is because, in physics, all physical elements like atoms and molecules are indistinguishable. For instance, any carbon atom in our body is identical to any other carbon atom in the universe with the same number of nuclear particles and orbital electrons. So, the idea of assembling the 'original' elements doesn't really make sense in the context of physics.
From a biological perspective, living beings are not made up of a static set of elements but are constantly changing and evolving systems. Cells and their components all have a finite lifespan. For example, most metabolites in a cell are replaced within a minute, mRNA molecules typically have a half-life of about 2 hours in human cells, and so on. Even slower tissues like the liver renew their cells approximately once a year. Despite this constant turnover, we consider an individual or a cell to be the 'same' over time, even though most of its physical components have changed. This suggests that it's the connections between cells and cellular components, rather than the specific physical or chemical compounds, that define a living system.
So, when we talk about 'resurrection', we're really talking about reconstructing all the processes, functions, and causal relationships within a system. We'll discuss later why we consider the reconstructed system as a 'resurrected' original rather than a copy. Briefly, this is because any attempt to create a detailed physical copy would ultimately destroy the original, leaving us with only one instance of the system. This makes the question of 'copy' and 'original' irrelevant in the context of general and quantum physics.
This leads us to the question, 'Can we resurrect lost consciousness?' While this might seem far-fetched, it's a crucial question when considering how to care for people in deep comas or vegetative states. Consciousness is the result of complex activity in a highly organized dynamic system like the human brain, which exists within a rich biochemical environment provided by bodily tissue. This system can be altered by disease or trauma in a way that destroys its ability to generate consciousness. So, the question becomes: how rich does the environment need to be to allow for the resurrection (reconstruction or re-implementation) of the dynamic system? Later in the paper, we'll propose some theoretical constraints to determine the richness of the environment and its ability to recover lost functions. These constraints could potentially guide tissue recovery therapies and the development of neuroprostheses.
We'll begin with a brief overview of existing theoretical models that discuss what resurrection might mean in terms of general physics, and what kind of universe might provide the physical conditions for such an event. Models like the 'Boltzmann brain' model and Tipler’s cosmological model of resurrection tie the problem of resurrection to the fundamental properties of our universe. The 'Big Wow' model suggests that the early universe had conditions for consciousness to emerge. This model could be extended with Vilenkin’s hypothesis of a tunneling universe, which suggests that the early universe and physical time emerged by tunneling through an initial singularity. We propose a tunneling of the 'Big Wow' state from the early universe to a final singularity, with each trajectory representing various states of consciousness throughout the universe's history. The final state will represent the sum of all these trajectories."

"Recently, a theory called the 'big rip' model has been proposed. This theory suggests that the universe could end in a 'big rip', where all matter is torn apart by the expansion of the universe. Some believe that this process could lead to conditions similar to other theories, such as the ones proposed by Tipler or the 'Big Wow' model.
However, these theories don't take into account the biological and informational aspects of consciousness. To address this, we can consider several methods for transferring the mind to a different medium, such as brain mapping and nanotechnology. This leads us to the question of whether we're copying the mind or actually moving it.
In recent years, some people have suggested that we could become cyborgs or reach a technological 'singularity' within this century by developing interfaces between the brain and computers. These ideas assume that we can transfer human consciousness and the mind from our biological bodies to an artificial environment. In this paper, I'll explore the mathematical and computational basis for this idea of 'mind uploading'.
The mind, as defined by Wikipedia, includes aspects of intellect and consciousness such as thought, perception, memory, emotion, will, and imagination. It's reasonable to assume that such a mind would need a complex system, like a brain, to function.
Most brain studies show that the mind requires complex self-organization processes within living brain tissue. Basic chemical processes produce energy and building blocks for the brain's neural network. Neurons and neural networks display complex behavior and produce byproducts that are removed from the brain tissue. So, to transfer the mind, we'd need to create a rich artificial environment that mimics the complexity of the real brain and allows the mind to continue its vital functions.
In my analysis, I'll focus on the properties of cellular networks and tissue functions. These properties, sometimes referred to as 'emergent' properties, arise from the whole and are not properties of individual parts. To simulate them, I'll construct a model of the mind's systems organization. The model will be developed as a network of causal interactions among hypothetical neural networks."
